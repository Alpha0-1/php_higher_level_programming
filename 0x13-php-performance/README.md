# PHP Performance Optimization

This repository contains practical examples and techniques for optimizing PHP applications. Each file focuses on a specific performance aspect with implementation examples.

## Files Overview

1. **0-benchmarking.php** - Measuring code execution time and memory usage
2. **1-caching.php** - Various caching strategies (file, Memcached, OPcache)
3. **2-optimization.php** - Code-level optimization techniques
4. **3-memory_management.php** - Memory usage optimization
5. **4-database_optimization.php** - Database performance techniques
6. **5-lazy_loading.php** - Deferred object initialization
7. **6-compression.php** - Data compression methods
8. **7-cdn_integration.php** - CDN integration patterns
9. **8-load_balancing.php** - Load balancing strategies
10. **9-monitoring.php** - Performance monitoring approaches
11. **100-profiling.php** - Code profiling tools and techniques
12. **101-scaling.php** - Application scaling strategies
13. **102-microservices.php** - Microservices architecture patterns

## How to Use

Each file is self-contained with examples and can be run independently (PHP CLI or web server). Some examples may require additional PHP extensions or services:

- For caching examples: Memcached/Redis extensions
- For profiling: XHProf or Blackfire extensions
- For database examples: PDO with MySQL

## Best Practices

1. Always measure before optimizing
2. Focus on bottlenecks that impact user experience
3. Consider both server-side and client-side performance
4. Implement monitoring to catch performance regressions
5. Balance between optimization and code maintainability

## Requirements

- PHP 8.0+
- Composer (for some examples that might need dependencies)
